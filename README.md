Tested on Linux, but should work on Windows, Mac and BSD too.

A tuch game color (tactile): You must click on the button with the correct color. Do not read the name of the color, just click on the good color.

You can play with a mouse too (if you have it)

Enjoy!

Still in alpha. Please do not report any bug.
